 About my Portfolio
 
This repository will serve as a centralized location for all my projects in Elements of Computing II (Spring 2025). I plan to structure my work into separate folders based on project typeâ€”whether it's exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, or model development. My goal is to ensure clarity and accessibility for both myself and others reviewing my work.

Looking ahead at this semester, I anticipate making four major updates to my GitHub, each corresponding to key milestones in the course. These updates will showcase my progress, including refining analytical techniques, improving visualization methods, and iterating on models. Additionally, I may include smaller updates such as code optimizations, documentation enhancements, or reflections on my learning process.

## Projects
### Tidy Data Project
ðŸ”— [View the Tidy Data Project Repository](https://github.com/cath2705/TidyData-Project)

ðŸ“„ Project Description
This project is based on Hadley Wickham's "Tidy Data" paper and explores the principles of organizing datasets to make analysis easier and more efficient. The project involves:

- Extracting and cleaning data from a combined column
- Separating gender and sport from composite strings
- Removing missing or irrelevant data
- Standardizing sport names and fixing formatting inconsistencies
- The result is a clean, well-structured dataset ready for analysis â€” where each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each table contains one type of observational unit.

### This project specfically 
- cleans up the data from a dataset file called olympics_08_medalists.csv
- this dataset shows Olympic medal data from the 2008 Summer Olympics
- after cleaning the data, I create visuals showing distrubtions of medals won across sports and genders :) 

### ðŸ’¼ This project highlights my ability to:
- Work with real-world messy data
- Apply data wrangling techniques using Python and pandas
- Follow best practices in data cleaning and structure
- It complements my portfolio by demonstrating attention to detail, data intuition, and proficiency in transforming raw datasets into clean, analyzable formats â€” skills essential for data analysis, machine learning, and reporting workflows.
