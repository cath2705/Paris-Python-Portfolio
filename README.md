 About my Portfolio
 
This repository will serve as a centralized location for all my projects in Elements of Computing II (Spring 2025). I plan to structure my work into separate folders based on project typeâ€”whether it's exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, or model development. My goal is to ensure clarity and accessibility for both myself and others reviewing my work.

Looking ahead at this semester, I anticipate making four major updates to my GitHub, each corresponding to key milestones in the course. These updates will showcase my progress, including refining analytical techniques, improving visualization methods, and iterating on models. Additionally, I may include smaller updates such as code optimizations, documentation enhancements, or reflections on my learning process.
