 About my Portfolio

This is where I will store all my projects for Elements of Computing II Spring 2025. I plan to organize my projects into seperate folders dependent on whether the project is EDA, a visualization, or a model. Looking ahead at this semester, I am planning to have 4 major updates to my Github.
