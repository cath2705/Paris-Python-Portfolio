Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that identifies and classifies important information—like names of people, places, organizations, dates, and more—from text.  
            
This website is designed to help you understand what NER is, how it works, and why it matters. Whether you are new to the concept or looking to explore its real-world applications, you'll find interactive tools and resources here to guide you.  

Use the sidebar to explore different sections of the app. Try out hands-on tools, learn about NER in context, and see how machines extract meaning from language.

        NER is used in tons of real-world applications!

        Entity Recognition isn’t just an academic concept—it’s a powerful tool that quietly drives innovation in the technologies we use every day. Behind the scenes, it's helping teams and developers extract meaning from language at scale, enabling smarter, faster, and more personalized systems across countless industries.
        
        **For example:**
        
        On a **hiring platform**, entity detection helps scan thousands of resumes, automatically identifying names, job titles, companies, degrees, and salaries—cutting down hours of manual work into seconds. 
        
        In **healthcare**, it’s used to process and sort patient data by recognizing medications, diagnoses, or symptoms within medical records, enabling faster and more accurate analysis.
        Even voice bots and virtual assistants rely on entity detection to understand what users are saying. When you say, “Call Dr. Smith at Stanford,” the system doesn’t just hear words—it understands that “Dr. Smith” is a person and “Stanford” is an organization, then uses that information to take meaningful action.

        Other real-world uese include...
        - 📰 News Aggregators  
        - 🔎 Search Engines  
        - 🧠 Knowledge Graphs  
        - 🏥 Medical Research  
        - 🕵️ Intelligence + Cybersecurity

        It's one of the **foundational skills** in applied NLP.
