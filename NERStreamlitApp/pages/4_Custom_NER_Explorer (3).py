                    This app is designed to give you hands-on experience with Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy—
                     with an added twist: you can inject your own custom rules to detect entities that might not otherwise 
                    be captured by a general-purpose model.
                    
                     ### 1. Enter Your Text
                    In the main section, enter or paste text in the textbox to analyze.
                     
                     ### 2. Add Custom Entity Rules (Optional)
                    On the left-hand sidebar, you can specify your own rules for recognizing entities:
                    
                    **Entity Label:** Enter a custom label that describes the type of entity (for example, PRODUCT, BRAND, or LOCATION).
                    
                    **Pattern Text:** Input the exact word (or token) you want to detect. The app will match occurrences of this word (case-insensitive) in your text.
                    
                    **Adding a Rule:** Click the "Add Entity Rule" button to save your rule. Your current custom rules will be listed below, so you can review them before processing.
                    
                    ### 3. Process Your Text
                    Once you have entered your text and added any custom rules you’d like, click the "Process Text" button.
                    The app then uses spaCy’s language model along with your custom rules to analyze the text, tagging any matching tokens or phrases.
                    
                     ### 4. Review the Results
                     After processing, the app highlights detected entities directly within the text.
                    
                    **Entity Labels:** Each highlighted section shows the entity type. This lets you see which parts of the text the model recognized (or you defined) as entities.
                    
                    **Dynamic Updates:** Feel free to adjust your text or add new rules and process the text again to see how the analysis changes.

    This kind of misclassification is actually pretty common with pre-trained spaCy models. Pre-trained spaCy models are trained on broad, general datasets and can struggle with domain-specific language, leading to misclassifications when encountering ambiguous or unfamiliar terms. They rely on statistical patterns, which might not capture nuanced meanings outside their training data.
    
    That’s why you want to add custom rules!
