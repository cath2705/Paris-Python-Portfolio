    Curious to see how Named Entity Recognition works in practice? Use this tool to input your own sentences and watch as the system identifies entities in real time.
    
    Type anything you like—maybe a news headline, a made-up story, or a sentence from your favorite book—and see which words the model picks out as names, places, organizations, dates, and more. As you experiment, pay attention to the context. Which words does the system correctly recognize? Which ones does it miss or misinterpret?
    
    This is your chance to think like an algorithm: what clues is it using to make decisions, and where might it be getting confused?

            **What happens if you misspell a word?**
            → Try “Gogle” instead of “Google,” or “Applle” instead of “Apple.”
            

            **What if you type a very long paragraph of text?**
            → Does spaCy still detect entities consistently across all of it?
            

            **How does it handle ambiguous words?**
            → Try: “I ate an apple while watching the Apple keynote.”

            
            **Can it recognize entities in different languages?**
            → Test with names or phrases in Spanish, French, etc. (e.g., “Elon Musk fue a París.”)
            

            **Does it pick up dates, money, or quantities?**
            → Try: “On January 5, Amazon spent $2 million on 3,000 new servers.”
            

            **How does casing affect detection?**
            → Try: “facebook” vs “Facebook”; “january” vs “January.”
