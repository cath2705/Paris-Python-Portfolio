In the early part of the second Trump administration (January‚ÄìApril 2025), the average effective U.S. tariff rate surged from **2.5% to an estimated 27%** ‚Äî the highest level in over a century.

This historic increase was fueled by proposed tariffs on imports from **57 countries**, ranging between **11% and 50%**. These tariffs were scheduled to take effect on **April 9, 2025**, but were later **suspended for 90 days ‚Äî except for China**, where implementation continued.

This interactive map will help you better understand the aforementioned average effective U.S. tariff rate (27% globally) on a country-by-country basis. It‚Äôs a hover map: simply move your mouse over any country to see the average effective tariff rate that the United States has imposed on that nation.

Please note that this map reflects **average** effective tariff rates of each country. This is important because, during the Trump administration's second term, tariffs were frequently adjusted‚Äîsome were increased, then quickly withdrawn, as shown in the tariff timeline on the previous page. As a result, rather than displaying a real-time tariff rate (which may differ at this exact moment), the map presents an average rate to give a more stable and meaningful view of U.S. trade policy over time.

                    To understand the impact of this freeze, you can compare **two maps:** one showing tariff rates **before April 9th** and one showing them **after.** This will help illustrate the dramatic shift in tariff intensity that **would have remained in effect if not for the pause.**

             ### üîç What‚Äôs Really Going On?
             
             A clear pattern emerges when comparing the pre- and post-April 9th tariffs:
             The new tariff map shows a dramatic reduction or elimination of tariffs for most countries, with China standing out as the sole nation facing a substantial increase. China‚Äôs new rate is 125%, represented by the darkest blue. This suggests a deliberate and strategic pivot, concentrating tariff pressure almost exclusively on China while easing trade restrictions elsewhere. 
              
            ---   
                
            Even more striking is the **post-freeze uniformity** ‚Äî nearly **every country except China now faces a flat 10% tariff**. This reset is not based on any specific trade behavior like tariffs, VATs, or digital services taxes. Instead, the new rates are **derived from a formula**:  
            > **Trade deficit √∑ U.S. imports**, with a **minimum tariff of 10%.**
            In short, these rates are mechanically determined by trade aggregates, not policy nuance.
            
            For example:
            - **Singapore**, a free-trade-oriented nation, and **Brazil**, which uses heavy tariffs and restrictions, both receive the **same 10% tariff** ‚Äî purely due to their goods trade balances with the U.S.
            - **Vietnam**, a country that has actively sought to align with U.S. policy, also receives no preferential treatment under the new system.
            
            > üìâ **Exports to the U.S. make up nearly 30% of Vietnam‚Äôs GDP.**  
            > Under the proposed formula, Vietnam narrowly avoided a devastating 46% tariff ‚Äî which could have pushed its economy into recession.  
            > Instead, it will now pay the 10% minimum.
            
            Meanwhile, even **close U.S. allies** with free trade agreements ‚Äî like **Australia** and **South Korea** ‚Äî are affected. Despite having **zero-tariff access** on many exports under past agreements, they now face a **significant shift** in their trade relationships due to the new flat-rate system.
            
            This reset represents a profound restructuring of U.S. trade policy logic ‚Äî from politically negotiated rates to formula-driven automation.
