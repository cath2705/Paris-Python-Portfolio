In the early part of the second Trump administration (January‚ÄìApril 2025), the average effective U.S. tariff rate surged from **2.5% to an estimated 27%** ‚Äî the highest level in over a century.

This historic increase was fueled by proposed tariffs on imports from **57 countries**, ranging between **11% and 50%**. These tariffs were scheduled to take effect on **April 9, 2025**, but were later **suspended for 90 days ‚Äî except for China**, where implementation continued.

The visualizations below compare:
- **Old Tariff Rates** (before April 9th, or pre-freeze)
- **New Tariff Rates** (after April 9th, or post-freeze)

You‚Äôll find **two interactive heat maps** displayed side-by-side:
- The **left map** shows **old (pre-April 9th)** tariff rates.
- The **right map** shows **new (post-April 9th)** tariff rates.

**Darker colors** indicate **higher tariff intensities**. You can:
- **Zoom**, pan, and explore both maps.
- **Hover over any country** to see the specific tariff rate the US imposed on that country

This tool is designed to help users **quickly understand** which regions were most affected.

    ### üîç What‚Äôs Really Going On?

    A clear pattern emerges when comparing the pre- and post-April 9th tariffs:

    The new tariff map shows a dramatic reduction or elimination of tariffs for most countries, with China standing out as the sole nation facing a substantial increase. China‚Äôs new rate is 125%, represented by the darkest blue. This suggests a deliberate and strategic pivot, concentrating tariff pressure almost exclusively on China while easing trade restrictions elsewhere. 

       ---   

    Even more striking is the **post-freeze uniformity** ‚Äî nearly **every country except China now faces a flat 10% tariff**. This reset is not based on any specific trade behavior like tariffs, VATs, or digital services taxes. Instead, the new rates are **derived from a formula**:  
    > **Trade deficit √∑ U.S. imports**, with a **minimum tariff of 10%.**

    In short, these rates are mechanically determined by trade aggregates, not policy nuance.

    For example:
    - **Singapore**, a free-trade-oriented nation, and **Brazil**, which uses heavy tariffs and restrictions, both receive the **same 10% tariff** ‚Äî purely due to their goods trade balances with the U.S.
    - **Vietnam**, a country that has actively sought to align with U.S. policy, also receives no preferential treatment under the new system.

    > üìâ **Exports to the U.S. make up nearly 30% of Vietnam‚Äôs GDP.**  
    > Under the proposed formula, Vietnam narrowly avoided a devastating 46% tariff ‚Äî which could have pushed its economy into recession.  
    > Instead, it will now pay the 10% minimum.

    Meanwhile, even **close U.S. allies** with free trade agreements ‚Äî like **Australia** and **South Korea** ‚Äî are affected. Despite having **zero-tariff access** on many exports under past agreements, they now face a **significant shift** in their trade relationships due to the new flat-rate system.

    This reset represents a profound restructuring of U.S. trade policy logic ‚Äî from politically negotiated rates to formula-driven automation.
