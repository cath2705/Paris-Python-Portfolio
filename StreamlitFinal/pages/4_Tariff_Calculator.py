    President Trump has stated that the goal of these tariffs is to put pressure on foreign governments and producers that, according to the administration, were engaging in unfair trade practices or flooding U.S. markets with underpriced goods. By imposing additional costs on these imports, the hope was to incentivize fairer trade relationships and create a more level playing field for American businesses.

    While tariffs are imposed on foreign goods, the cost is often passed on to U.S. importers, retailers, and ultimately, consumers. Because many products sold in the U.S. still come from abroad, American households often experienced higher prices on items ranging from electronics and appliances to clothing and raw materials.

    In some cases, even domestic producers raised their prices, reflecting reduced competition or increased costs for parts and materials they also import. For example, tariffs on steel affected not only foreign producers but also U.S. companies that rely on steel to manufacture goods.

st.markdown("""
 **Purpose**
            
This tool helps you estimate how much more your typical items may cost due to tariffs.  
You don‚Äôt need to know the specific tariff rates‚Äîjust where the product was made.  
This tool will automatically apply the correct tariff percentage based on the country of origin and calculate the final cost for you.

 **How to Use**

1. **Enter the original price** of your product in U.S. dollars.""")
with st.expander("What Do We Mean by Original Price?"):
        st.markdown("""
                    When we refer to the original price of an item, we mean its cost **before any of President Trump‚Äôs tariff actions were implemented**‚Äîspecifically, before **April 4th,** when the initial round of tariffs (referred to as "old tariffs") went into effect.
It‚Äôs important to clarify that these ‚Äúold tariffs‚Äù were in place for only a brief period‚Äî**from April 4th to April 9th**‚Äîbefore a temporary tariff freeze was announced on **April 9th.** This freeze introduced **new tariff rates,** which are being referred to as temporary by the Trump administration and are expected to last for a **90-day period.** After this period, it's anticipated that tariffs will return to the previous (April 4‚Äì9) rate.
When we use terms like old and new tariffs, we are not comparing pre-Trump and Trump-era tariffs. Instead, we are comparing two Trump-era rates:
* **Old tariffs** = Tariff rates from **April 4‚Äì9**
* **New tariffs** = Adjusted, temporary rates **after April 9**
In many cases (excluding China), the new tariff rates should actually reduce the cost of goods compared to the old rates. This is because the post-April 9 rates are part of a temporary freeze intended to ease the intensity of the tariffs. However, it‚Äôs important not to be misled‚Äî**both tariff rates were introduced under the Trump administration,** and the lower rate is only temporary.
To accurately understand price changes, it is useful to compare item costs under both tariff scenarios. But when we refer to original cost, we specifically mean the **price of the item before any tariffs were enacted at all**‚Äîthat is, **before April 4th.**

Projections of proposed tariffs on tech products reveal significant consequences for U.S. consumers, with sharp increases in retail prices across essential electronics and an estimated 120 billion dollar reduction in consumer **purchasing power.** 
This matters because tariffs, often aimed at protecting domestic industries, **can unintentionally burden everyday consumers‚Äîespecially** in sectors like technology that touch nearly every aspect of modern life. 
For instance, laptops and tablets would face a 45% price hike, with average costs rising by 357 dollars
and 201 dollars, respectively, while smartphones could go up by 213 dollars. 
Even smaller accessories like headphones and batteries would see noticeable increases. 
These projections show that industry-wide tariffs don‚Äôt just affect manufacturers‚Äîthey ripple through the economy, reducing what consumers can afford, slowing tech adoption, and disproportionately impacting lower- and middle-income households.

                    **Purchasing power** refers to the amount of goods or services that a person can buy with a certain amount of money. When prices go up‚Äîlike in the case of tariffs‚Äîyour purchasing power goes down because the same amount of money buys you **less** than it did before.
                    
                    For example, if you had 1,000 dollars to spend on tech and laptops used to cost 500 dollars, you could buy two. But if tariffs raise laptop prices to 750 dollar each, now you can only afford one. Your **purchasing power has decreased** even though the amount of money you have hasn‚Äôt changed.
