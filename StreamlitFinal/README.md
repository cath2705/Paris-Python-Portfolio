### üìå Project Overview
Welcome to an interactive web app designed to explore the global impact of U.S. tariffs implemented during the Trump administration. This tool offers multiple interactive features to help users visualize and understand tariff policy in context.

<br />

Through this app, I demonstrate how to make complex trade policy more accessible by combining data visualization, historical context, and interactive tools. Users can explore U.S. tariff impacts in a hands-on way‚Äîunderstanding not just the what, but also the when, where, and why behind major policy shifts.

## Goals: 
- **Visualize the evolution of U.S. tariff policy** through an interactive, image-rich timeline of major global trade events during the Trump administration.
- **Map the global impact of U.S. tariffs** using an intuitive hover map that shows the average effective tariff rate per country.
- **Clarify the difference between old and new tariff** policies, especially around the April 9th freeze, by enabling users to compare rates over time.
- **Demonstrate real-world effects** with a tariff calculator that shows how price changes for imported goods vary based on country of origin and tariff policy shifts.
- **Promote critical thinking** about trade policy through hands-on interaction, visual storytelling, and historical context‚Äînot just raw numbers.

## App Layout
The app is divided into three main pages:
- **Timeline Page**
Explore an interactive timeline featuring key events, complete with images and descriptions, that shaped recent U.S. tariff policy.

<br />

- **Global Map Page**
View a hover-enabled world map that displays the average effective U.S. tariff rate imposed on each country. This provides a broad, comparative view of tariff intensity across the globe.

<br />

- **Tariff Calculator Page** 
Enter the base price of an item and instantly calculate its cost after U.S. tariffs, based on the selected country's average tariff rate.

<br />

## ‚öôÔ∏è App Features

**"Tariff Timeline" Page:**
- Loads an interactive timeline using the streamlit_timeline component and custom JSON data.
- Displays key global tariff events during Trump‚Äôs 2025 administration, including executive orders and international responses.
