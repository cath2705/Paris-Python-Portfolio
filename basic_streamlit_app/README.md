About my Basic Penguins Streamlit App!

I used Streamlit to create an interactive data exploration app for the Palmer Penguins dataset. This app leverages Streamlitâ€™s interactive components to allow users to filter, visualize, and analyze penguin data dynamically.

The app starts with a welcoming title and provides an easy-to-use interface with sidebar filters and interactive plots.
I used st.sidebar.multiselect() to create multi-selection dropdowns for users to filter data and I used .unique() to extract unique species and islands dynamically.
By incoperating def["species"].isin(species) the app filters the dataset based on user selection.

By using the st.checkbox("Show Raw Data") command, I created a checkbox that users can click to toggle raw data on and off. Users can also filter the data by species using the sidebar options (which also allows for real-time data exploration). 

By using st.button() I creates a button that, when clicked, executes code.
By using random.choice(facts) the app will select and display a random fact from a predefined list.
By using st.success() renders the selected fact with a highlighted success message.
All this comes toegther so that when users click the fun fact button, users learn random facts, adding a fun touch to the app.
